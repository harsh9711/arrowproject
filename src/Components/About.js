 <p><strong>Arrow Market</strong> is a decentralized options AMM on Avalanche. We implement a dynamic AMM that handles the creation and settlement of options on crypto-assets as well as the delta hedging of the pool. Arrow democratizes market making by allowing anybody to easily contribute liquidity to the protocol in addition to the conventional market makers in exchange for platform income.</p>
  </div>
  <div className="features">
    <h2>Features</h2>
<li>Cash-settled: A single numeraire is used to settle all contingent claims. This means underliers can be on-chain or off-chain.</li>
<li>Decentralized: Code is Law that replaces centralized settlement. Implemented through a network of DACs.</li>
<li>Fast and Secure: Runs on Avalanche virtual machines. Front runner resistant and blazing fast.</li>
<li>Prolific: Customize and combine options, call spreads, and put spreads.</li>
  </div>
  <div className="technology">
    <h2>The Technology Suite</h2>
<p>The Arrow protocol implements a decentralized aggregate counterparty (DAC) to act as both a settlement authority and a funding vehicle for each user-chosen reference asset. We call the DAC coupled with a contract factory a decentralized financial market (DFM). DFMs live on blockchains and generate economies of scale for contingent contract creation and settlement.</p>
